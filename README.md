Customer Value and Predictive Modeling
====================================== 

My goal with this project was to perform some exploratory data analysis on Olist marketplace data to find some factors that could affect customer purchases. With this information, I wanted to create a model to show which factors could help predict how much money a new customer would spend in their first six months of purchasing.


My presentation slides with visualizations and a small write up can be found in [olist_capstone.pdf](https://github.com/Carlene/olist_project/blob/master/olist_capstone.pdf).
